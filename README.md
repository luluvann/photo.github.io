Hello,

Welcome to my very first website project (hello world project in HTML) using existing CSS W3Schools style sheet and HTML : https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css

I am displaying my very own photos that I took while traveling.
You can access the website here : https://luluvann.github.io/photo.github.io/

Hope you'll enjoy it!

Lucile
